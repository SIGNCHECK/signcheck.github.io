    intro: "This is the third seven-star hotel in the world, this is exploring the unknown ocean kingdom, this is a dreamland full of imagination, this is... our most proud work. The entire plot of 540,000 square meters of fantasy paradise, plus a tourism complex with Eastern and Western characteristics and Sanya's local culture, create novel experiences and beautiful travel memories.\n Under the style narration of the theme of \"Marine Civilization\", the local environment and climate are also considered. In order to withstand the outdoor sunlight, wind and rain, we innovatively adopted anti-corrosion cement, combined with smart three-dimensional sculpture, \"moisturizing things silently\" to ensure the travel experience and space aesthetics.",

    intro: "The concept intends to better blend in with the surrounding space by utilizing specific materials and placements between sign panel and text to create unity. Chic elements are used to emphasize on youthfulness of the space.\n For exteror signage, mirrored stainless steel is used to allow the reflective material to work as a source of connection between the landscape and the sign. To add playfulness in the signage, real plants are grown in between the sign panels in the middle to give it a natural touch.\nIn terms of interior signage, the concept of blending in is meant to carry through, using a different approach. While flexibility is part of the requirements to allow easy replacement of some of the contents, it is intended to incorporat half individual letters with a sign panel, but to better connect them as one. Overlay is used as a technique to join the two together so that the signage will not appear so much as an add-on into the space.\nEnergetic colours are being used to represent different buildings and areas, showing positive energy and spirit within the school.",
