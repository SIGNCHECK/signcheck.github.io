    intro: "The concept intends to better blend in with the surrounding space by utilizing specific materials and placements between sign panel and text to create unity. Chic elements are used to emphasize on youthfulness of the space.\n For exteror signage, mirrored stainless steel is used to allow the reflective material to work as a source of connection between the landscape and the sign. To add playfulness in the signage, real plants are grown in between the sign panels in the middle to give it a natural touch.\nIn terms of interior signage, the concept of blending in is meant to carry through, using a different approach. While flexibility is part of the requirements to allow easy replacement of some of the contents, it is intended to incorporat half individual letters with a sign panel, but to better connect them as one. Overlay is used as a technique to join the two together so that the signage will not appear so much as an add-on into the space.\nEnergetic colours are being used to represent different buildings and areas, showing positive energy and spirit within the school.",
